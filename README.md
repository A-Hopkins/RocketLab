# RocketLab
Laboratory for model rocket simulations and control.


## Goals
Currently, the goals of the model rocket (to be designed) will be to launch and land in a predefined landing zone. Thrust vector control will be implemented to aid in the flight trajectory and the landing. The landing will be a rocket powered landing. 

### Software
**C/C++**  
The software used will be created for a flight computer (tba) that will run the trajectory analysis, when to fire the motor, and actuator control for the thrust vector control.

----

**Python**  
There will be a light weight simulator that will be able to provide basic information about the rocke to aide in design. This part of the project should be designed with the ease of use for any model rocket enthusiast and thus, a GUI is being created to run the simulations. The program will be packaged in a convientent way to allow for easy download and use.

### Flight
The goal of the rocket flight will be to go to apogee and return to a specific location with a rocket powered descent/landing. The landing zone will be predetermined before launch
